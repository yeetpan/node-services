Port, RabbitMQ, MongoDB and other details can be confired in index.js file of relevant service.

`Note: carefully configure User service, Post service and Post service URLs in Aggregator service.`


## Running the Services

In each service folder (`aggregator-service/`, `comment-service/`, `user-service/`, `post-service/`), run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
cd aggregator-service  # Navigate to aggregator-service folder
npm start

cd ../comment-service  # Navigate to comment-service folder
npm start

cd ../user-service  # Navigate to user-service folder
npm start

cd ../post-service  # Navigate to post-service folder
